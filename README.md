Machine Learning:

    Just simply run each file to peform machine learning algorithm on the dataset that is loaded near the top of the file. 

    For model-1:
        the model-1.py file contains all necessary code to run cleaning, analysis and ML on the data within the same file, alt_dataset is code that was initially developed but after testing was proven unsatisfactory, therefore model_1.py was developed

    Model-2:
        model_2.py runs some analysis aswell as data-2-analysis.py. preprocessor-2.py was used to convert the given dataset into a clean jsonl file which features in the data folder. The rest of the files are name after their associated model

    Model-3:
        The same workflow as Model-2.
